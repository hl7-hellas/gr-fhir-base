You can download different files and aspects of this implementation guide below.

### Specification

A downloadable version of this IG is available so it can be hosted locally:

- [Entire implementation guide](full-ig.zip)

### NPM Package and Definitions

The following package file includes an NPM package file. It contains all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages and URLs in the IG, etc., defined as part of this version of the Implementation Guides. This file SHOULD be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since it contains all the rules about what makes the profiles valid. Implementers must still be familiar with the specification content and profiles that apply to create a conformant implementation. See the validating profiles and resources documentation in FHIR for more information.

- [Package(compressed folder)](package.tgz)

In addition, there are format specific definition files:

- the NPM Package and Definitions resources in [JSON](definitions.json.zip), [XML](definitions.xml.zip), [TTL](definitions.ttl.zip), or [CSV](csvs.zip) format, or
- the example resources in [JSON](examples.json.zip), [XML](examples.xml.zip) or [TTL](examples.ttl.zip) format.

The source code for this Implementation Guide can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hl7-hellas/gr-fhir-base)
